How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

 Ensuring my code, program, or software is function and secure, I can now write test cases. Using test cases is rather important to make sure my code does as it is intended. Testing that there are no bugs or anyting wrong with my code. Writing test cases first then writing the base code has helped me tremendously as I can put in the requirements immediately and build off of the test cases. Tjen looking at the Junit coverage percentage as well can help me ensure my code is proper and everything is working correctly. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

What the user needs is based on the requirements, and making sure I get all of those requirements helps me incorporate them into the program efficiently. 


How do I approach designing software?

I approach it with fresh eyes and a changed mindset. Slowing down and reading the requirements from the users, then writing code with the test cases in place and testing everything to make sure it works properly.
